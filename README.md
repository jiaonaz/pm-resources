Readings, playbooks, templates, and more for product managers

Hello! I've gotten a lot of requests over the years for recommended readings on product management. Since teaching at Stanford, I've created a reading list for my students. Sharing that here, along with a playbook and templates for other key tools, such as PRDs (also known as specs or 1-pagers), planning processes, scorecards (for OKR/glao tracking) and more. Hope folks find it helpful :)
