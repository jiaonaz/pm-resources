# Vision & Mission

### Overview
Every team needs a strong vision. The vision keeps the team aligned, enables each person to make independent decisions and weigh tradeoffs. A team’s vision is the version of the world they want to see. All of the team’s work is in service to the vision. With this much on the line, it’s important to get right. Here’s how. 

**Vision vs. Mission:** Many teams and companies use these terms interchangeably, but they are different and serve different needs. This [site](https://www.clearvoice.com/blog/difference-between-mission-vision-statement-examples/) does a good job explaining the difference between the two, which can be summarized as follows:  

   * Vision: What the team wants to be true for Airbnb  
   * Mission: What the team aims to accomplish  

### Deliverables
**Workshop & Statements:** This activity will help the team align on a vision statement and on a mission statement, and is best held outside the office. Here are a few steps that tend to work well:

* Prior to the event, prepare a handful of vision statements and mission statements.
* Once at the event, share these statements with the team. These are foundational ideas – a creative starting place. They are not options.
* Team members should contribute their own vision & mission statements (post-its are good here).
* Cluster the statements into themes and refine.
* Buy-in is critical, and the Product Manager will need to make the final call as they are ultimately responsible.

Keep in mind, the final vision statement should be a piece of the company’s broader vision, and the final mission statement should be achievable by the team and ladder up to the mission of the larger department and organization. 

**Leadership Alignment:** Once the team has these statements, it is important to meet with leadership and partner teams to communicate the team’s intended directive and get feedback. This will be particularly helpful in the future when you need to make hard tradeoffs. This early alignment will made these decisions easier.

Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed
--- | --- | --- | ---
Core team | Product Manager | Leadership, and partner teams | Department and organization

Don’t forget: Your vision and mission are not the path (or “how”) we get to that end state. That is articulated by your strategy – and it comes next.

### Examples

_Content Moderation_ 
   * _Vision: User generated content is safe and trusted._ 
   * _Mission: Ensure user generated content is appropriate and free of malicious intent._ 

_Host Success_
   * _Vision: Every host on Airbnb is the best entrepreneur they can be._
   * _Mission: Help each host reach their potential._

### Frequency
It should happen within the first three months of joining a team, or as a first thing when a new team is formed. Check-in every year after that.
