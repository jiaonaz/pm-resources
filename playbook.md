# Vision & Mission

### Overview
Every team needs a strong vision. The vision keeps the team aligned, enables each person to make independent decisions and weigh tradeoffs. A team’s vision is the version of the world they want to see. All of the team’s work is in service to the vision. With this much on the line, it’s important to get right. Here’s how. 

**Vision vs. Mission:** Many teams and companies use these terms interchangeably, but they are different and serve different needs. This [site](https://www.clearvoice.com/blog/difference-between-mission-vision-statement-examples/) does a good job explaining the difference between the two, which can be summarized as follows:  

   * Vision: What the team wants to be true for the company  
   * Mission: What the team aims to accomplish  

### Deliverables
**Workshop & Statements:** This activity will help the team align on a vision statement and on a mission statement, and is best held outside the office. Here are a few steps that tend to work well:

* Prior to the event, prepare a handful of vision statements and mission statements.
* Once at the event, share these statements with the team. These are foundational ideas – a creative starting place. They are not options.
* Team members should contribute their own vision & mission statements (post-its are good here).
* Cluster the statements into themes and refine.
* Buy-in is critical, and the Product Manager will need to make the final call as they are ultimately responsible.

Keep in mind, the final vision statement should be a piece of the company’s broader vision, and the final mission statement should be achievable by the team and ladder up to the mission of the larger department and organization. 

**Leadership Alignment:** Once the team has these statements, it is important to meet with leadership and partner teams to communicate the team’s intended directive and get feedback. This will be particularly helpful in the future when you need to make hard tradeoffs. This early alignment will made these decisions easier.

Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed
--- | --- | --- | ---
Core team | Product Manager | Leadership, and partner teams | Department and organization

Don’t forget: Your vision and mission are not the path (or “how”) we get to that end state. That is articulated by your strategy – and it comes next.

### Examples

_Content Moderation at Facebook_ 
   * _Vision: User generated content is safe and trusted._ 
   * _Mission: Ensure user generated content is appropriate and free of malicious intent._ 

_Hosting at Airbnb_
   * _Vision: Every host on Airbnb is the best entrepreneur they can be._
   * _Mission: Help each host reach their potential._

### Frequency
It should happen within the first three months of joining a team, or as a first thing when a new team is formed. Check-in every year after that.


# Strategy & Prioritization

### Overview
Strategies help you answer ‘how’ you will meet your vision. Clear strategies ensures that your team are working on the right things. By working on the most important areas first, you increase the impact of your work.

### Deliverables
Strategies apply at both the team level, and at the project level.

**Team Strategies:** Each team should have a short list of strategies (often 3-4) that align the team’s work. Before you create team strategies, consider your environment. Every company works differently, and your strategies should work within yours. It can be helpful to brainstorm with your team the unique challenges of your environment, prior to you discussion on strategies. Once ready, a team can arrive at strategies by identifying options and creating themes.

**Project Prioritization:** Your team should also prioritize upcoming projects. A tried and true prioritization framework is [RICE](https://www.intercom.com/blog/rice-simple-prioritization-for-product-managers/) – or (Reach x Impact x Confidence) / Effort. As an alternative, you can stack rank your team’s strategies, and make an assessment about which projects will have the largest impact on each strategy.

### Frequency
Should be aligned to overall team/org/company planning. Typically, plan team strategies for at least a quarter to a half. Evaluate every six weeks and identify and iterate on what's not working. Project prioritization should also be planned for 6 weeks to a quarter, and re-evaluated prior to starting each sprint (again, can depend on your team's cadence).


# Goal Setting

### Overview
Goals provide alignment at the team and organizational level, “You make what you measure.” They provide a clear way for each group to express value to the organization. Once the goals are set, you need to consider how to track and attribute efforts against them.

### Deliverables
The [OKR](https://medium.com/startup-tools/okrs-5afdc298bc28) framework – short for Objectives and Key Results — is a good one for tracking goals . An objective is a qualitative goal that will take many months, or even years to accomplish. The key results are measurable steps you need in order to meet your objectives. It makes sense to use OKRs if your entire company or organization uses that format, so that it's clear how the OKRs cascade. If your company does not use the OKR framework, an alternative to ensure that your results are measurable is another framework called SMART goals. SMART goals are specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound. To learn more, this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-SvuFIQjK8) and [link](https://www.smartsheet.com/blog/essential-guide-writing-smart-goals) do a good job explaining. 


### Frequency
Goals are usually set on an annual basis. However, it's important to add quarterly milestones (with goals) and add pacing on a continuous basis. This ensures the team and leadership know how they are tracking toward the broader goal. 


# Execution

### Overview
Proper execution is about efficiency. It increases the velocity of the team. In a resource constrained environment, velocity is crucial.

### Deliverables
The Product Manager is responsible for building an operating system for the team. The operating system is defined as a set of tools and processes used to track upcoming and ongoing work.

**Roadmap:** there are a million ways to track your team’s progress against the roadmap: a spreadhseheet, JIRA, Asana, Trello, post-it notes, etc. What’s important is that each member can easily access the essential information: their priorities, upcoming projects, coordination across functions and alignment on project commitments for that quarter. Also consider what other teams at the company are using. 

**Unified process:** Each product team should have a product backlog and use a sprint-driven process. The Product Manager is responsible for leading the team in how they work, a strong partnership with the Engineering Manager and Design Lead is critical, and individual duties are shared across the whole team. 

Typical activities required for a robust product backlog:
   * Create a list of user stories
   * Prioritize the stories
   * Add detail / further refine the stories
   * Estimate stories

Activities across the sprint:
   * Define sprint process and meeting cadence
   * Groom backlog
   * Host a sprint planning meeting
   * Conduct the sprint
   * Host wrap-up: demo and retrospective

**Brainstorming:** There are many ways to brainstorm the list of user stories, but what’s important is that not all ideas come from the PM (or any single person). Accordingly, we recommend hosting a brainstorm at least once a quarter. Data science and research should inform the discussion, then select a few critical questions to explore for the coming quarter. Once digitized, capture these ideas and update the status on them. This will close the loop on the process and increase trust that ideas can come from anywhere. 

**Planning documentation:** Create planning documents for feedback, coordination and sharing. Prepare a quarterly plan and distribute this to stakeholders within and around the team. At the end of the quarter, create a wrap-up document that captures learnings and holds the team accountable to work they committed to accomplish. This improves future planning processes and increases the accuracy of estimates. 

**Team Meeting:** In addition to sprint meetings, a bi-weekly team meeting that focuses on short, medium, and long-term team needs is also recommended. 

**Reporting:** Reporting increases efficiency. If leadership and other teams know about the work that is happening, they can more easily spot misalignment. This increased visibility also enables them to support the team more quickly, when needed. Work with your manager to pick one, or both of the following ways of reporting:

   * Recurring Status Email: Send an email on a recurring basis (frequency is flexible) to leadership and relevant teams.The content of the email is also flexible, but a format that has worked well is: surface your most important projects, identify where they are in development, and highlight any potential risks, or blockers. 
   * Recurring Product Review Meeting: Meet with leadership in your org (product management, design, engineering) in order to share out your latest strategy, prioritization, and execution of your roadmap. Bubble up any concerns you have and hear out your leadership’s concerns. This is a very valuable opportunity to obtain feedback on complex decisions that your team needs to make.  

Building a clean, usable dashboard is a great passive communication tool for both the team, and partner teams. The most important aspect of any dashboard is that it should be easy to parse. Stress test this asking someone unfamiliar with the work to draw conclusions from the data.

**Attribution:** An eternal questions is “what was the incremental impact of your team?” Without an agree-upon attribution framework, it can be difficult to explain what your team contributed beyond what would’ve happened anyway. There are no perfect counterfactuals. To help, employ A/B testing when relevant to run clean experiments to demonstrate incremental impact. From there, use either tops-down (against a forecast) or bottoms-up (counting each experiment) attribution to report the impact of your team’s work. Some teams are better suited for both setting up and benefiting from attribution (e.g. growth teams). There are times when you're working on a zero to one product, where attribution can be much tougher; do your best and work with leadership on define what success looks like. 


# Team Culture

### Overview
A healthy team depends on trust and strong interpersonal ties. These can be hard to build in a work-only environment. By building a strong team culture, you can ensure people enjoy coming to work each day, are motivated to do their best work, and stay with the team. 

On a product team, the PM will either be one of the leaders or *the* leader. As a leader, it is vital that you establish a great team culture so that the team’s full potential can be realized. A good team culture means that each member of the team feels like they belong on the team, and at the company. A toxic culture causes team members to question their role on the team, or worse, at the company.

### Building an Amazing Culture
   * **Celebrate Wins:** After you launch a project, celebrate the milestone with your team! This could be something as simple as a launch email, and more intricate as a project team lunch. Celebrating team wins shows team members how fun it is to work as a group to overcome a challenge together. 

   * **Acknowledge Good Work:** Always give credit to team members. If there is an organizational award that you can nominate team members for, put in the time to nominate someone in your team. 

   * **Cultivate a Culture of Appreciation:** Related to acknowledging good work, appreciate team members who help out with tasks. In regular team meetings, carve out a portion of the agenda that allows team members to appreciate one another (e.g. “I appreciate Sara for stamping my PR yesterday and giving me good feedback on my code changes.”) 

   * **Foster Effective Communication:** Make sure that everyone in your team understands how others in your team prefer to be communicated with. For example, some team members dislike context switching and would prefer that you don’t go up to them as they are coding away listening to music (they’d rather you send them an email or Slack). Other team members may find email and Slack impersonal and would rather dive into something with you in-person. There is no right answer and the key thing is for the team to know how others in the team want to be communicated with, and to establish those norms as a group. 

   * **Stop Interrupting:** Train yourself and your team to stop interrupting people when they talk. Interrupting others is something we all do, but we can all do less of by being present to the fact that from time to time, we interrupt. Raise this issue with your team so that it is top of mind, and encourage the team to feel empowered to call out when someone interrupts them in a meeting or in a 1-1 conversation. Related to interrupting, make sure that you take unconscious bias training. 

   * **Celebrate Birthdays & Anniversaries:** Whether it is something as simple as wishing a team member a happy birthday or happy anniversary over Slack, or something a little more thought out like getting the whole team to sign a card for him/her, or even more thought out like taking someone out for lunch, finding these extra reasons to celebrate life’s milestones will foster a sense of joy amongst the team. 
 
   * **Conduct Retrospectives & Learn From Mistakes:** At least once a quarter, do a team retrospective where the entire team asks itself what can be done from a process standpoint to improve the team. In this retrospective, there will surely be ideas that are raised that will not only improve execution velocity and the team’s product, but as importantly, the team’s culture. Make sure everyone in the team feels heard. 

   * **Give Facetime to the Team:** Make yourself available to your team in the form of 1:1s. Speak with the relevant team members and set up a cadence where you are being useful to the team member, but it is not taking up a prohibitive amount of your overall bandwidth. 

   * **Team Offsites:** One of the best ways to bring the team together is through a team offsite. Some ideas: Escape rooms, Cooking classes, and a team hike (great for teams on a budget!)
 
   * **Give Visibility to your Team:**  Find ways to have other team members present the work your team is doing. People get sick of hearing the PM talk all the time and the team member will feel empowered if they are asked to present something when they typically are not front-and-center presenting something.
